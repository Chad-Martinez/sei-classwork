##### JAVASCRIPT MODULE 308 SBA #####

Written in JavaScript and TypeScript

Program takes a variety of education insitution data and transforms it a consolidated array of student assignment scores and class weighted average.

A variety of helper functions are available to add and average numbers as well as compare dates.

The program first compares course information to ensure compatible data and then separates all unique learners (students) and finally sorts the data into individual arrays for each student. 

The program then starts the process of mapping the data into the specified format by calculating assignment scores, taking into account a penalty for late submissions, excluding non-gradable assignments, such as assignments not yet due or errors in scoring data.  It then returns that data combined with the id for that learner.
